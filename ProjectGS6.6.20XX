The Personalised Computer is a specialized Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation computer that is hypothesized to have been used in certain aspects of Super Mario 64, including the Personalisation AI. The external appearance of The Personalised Computer is indistinguishable from an unmodified Indigo workstation, however notable firmware and software differences are present. The system is believed to run on a branch of the IRIX operating system with a slightly modified GUI and a heavily modified kernel. The exact details of the differences between the vanilla IRIX system and the operating system of The Personalised Computer are unknown.

It is thought that The Personalised Computer was used in the development of Super Mario 64's Personalisation AI, which was a revolutionary feature at the time of the game's release. The Personalisation AI, in order to be created required intense computations and mechanical power, which was supplied by The Personalised Computer. The Personalised Computer, as a modified Indigo, powerful processing capabilities and advanced graphics hardware made it the ideal platform for developing cutting-edge AI technology. Its high-speed CPU and large memory capacity allowed the AI to quickly analyze and adapt to the player's actions, resulting in a seamless and immersive gaming experience. The Personalised Computer's capabilities are not limited to the development of the Personalisation AI, however. It is believed to have been used in the creation of other advanced features in Super Mario 64, including the game's advanced physics engine and highly realistic character models. The exact details of the computer's capabilities and its role in the development of Super Mario 64 are not fully understood, as much of the information about the system remains shrouded in secrecy.

The location of The Personalised Computer is unknown. It is likely lost or destroyed. The last documented and confirmed usage of an Indigo which is theorized to be The Personalisation AI was in 1994 by Mr. Seiyro.

EmulAI is a supposed Nintendo 64 emulator that some people claim to have downloaded that reportedly can somehow simulate the Personalization A.I. in Super Mario 64. Many of the reports are rather vague and dubious, though there are enough to have a general idea of the emulator and how it works. Some stories say that the Personalization A.I. is automatically active in the emulator, while others say that the Personalization A.I. is merely a plug-in. PromptEMU is a sdk contained wihin  the kit as a sdk that generates emulators prompts and anything related to code using kosmosII also hte code interptre has a GAN that can add features over time from dream patterns while the user is sleeping if the laptop heatwaves detect sleep patterns
